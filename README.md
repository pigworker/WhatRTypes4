# WhatRTypes4
being the materials from my YOW LambdaJam 2016 talk

On the afternoon of Tuesday 26 April, 2016, Conor McBride was hosting the [23rd Agda Implementors Meeting](http://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php?n=Main.AIMXXIII) at the university of Strathclyde. He ducked
out to give his last [CS410](https://github.com/pigworker/CS410-15) lecture of the year, then filled a bag
with whisky and clothes and headed to Glasgow airport.

On the morning of Thursday 28 April, 2016, Conor McBride arrived at Brisbane airport, still wearing the
same t-shirt. He cleared immigration and customs, was collected by a pre-booked cab, and delivered to
Queensland University of Technology. There, they gave him a cup of black coffee and a clean t-shirt, and
he gave this [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U3lV5VPmOU).

This repo contains the code edited live in that talk (in files Types4.hs, then Types4.agda), the emacs
key-bindings used to move between &lsquo;slides&rsquo; and to (de)activate code regions, and some other
random hackings from the plane.
